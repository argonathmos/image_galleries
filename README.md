## Here is a collection of *image galleries* I am developping for different projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Image Gallery 1:
Animated slideshow for mobile / landscape mode.
Using the CSS `transition` property, and JavaScript `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` functions to automatically animate the slideshow.
